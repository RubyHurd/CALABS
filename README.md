# CALABS
Work Scheduling App
When labs are overloaded and understaffed, it's important to have coverage for every shift and department. That's where CALABS can help.
CALABS is a scheduling application that, in theory, will help hospitals and labs create schedules for departments with limited staff, creating coverage for all shifts.
